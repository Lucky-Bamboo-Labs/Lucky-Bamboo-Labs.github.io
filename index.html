      <h1>Lucky Bamboo Labs 🎋🎍</h1>
      <p>
        we are a semi-real research lab focused on a couple goals:
      </p>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Better evals:</b> benchmarks that fight memorization, and are more based on model skill/logic ability</li>
        <li><b>Using Mech Interp:</b> most mech interp papers have ground breaking applications (control vectors, abliteration, etc), but most papers aren't implemented in a community usable method and have never been tested outside safety, so a mech interp toolkit thats hf or other code compatible could be nice</li>
      </ul>

      <p> we are a small team of ai enthusiasts/programmers/olympiad bros, and we think neural nets are grown, not made. We intend to find the limits of these NNs, how they learn what they learn, and how we can make better NNs.  
      </p>

      <p>Our official account is <b><a href="https://x.com/lucky86876">@lucky86877</a></b>, DM us if you have papers/experimental-results you think we could use, and we would really appreaciate any funds/GPU-hours you have to spare</p>

      <p>working on evals, new release soon</p>
